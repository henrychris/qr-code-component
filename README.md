## Overview

## My process

First, I sectioned the design into boxes. Based off those boxes, I created the HTML structure.
I had to review my notes when trying to position the card in the centre.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Learned to structure content using semantic HTML.
- Learned to use CSS variables.
- Learned to use CSS resets.
- Learned to use box sizing
- Learned the very basics of Flex, although I need to review it.
- Learned to center an element by setting a `max-width` and setting left and right margins to `auto`.
- Learned to center an element using Flex.
- Learned to use `vh` length to fill an element in the viewport. 1vh

### Continued development

I don't fully understand Flex or layouts in general. I'm also not fully comfortable with assigning measurements to elements.
